# Hello, GitHub!

Hello there! I'm Willy Vanderpool, a 17-year-old Computer Information Science student at Ozarks Technical Community College (OTC). I'm currently the president of OTC's tech club, Tech2Gether. My programming journey began long before college, driven by curiosity and creativity. I’m experienced with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Lua, and C#. Beyond programming, I enjoy drawing pixel art, collecting Pokémon cards, 3D printing, and playing video games with my friends.
