# Hello, GitHub!

Hello there! My name is William Vanderpool, also known as WillyV, I'm 17 years old and I am a first year Computer Information Science student at Ozarks Technical Community College (OTC). I'm currently Project Lead for Tech2Gether's website, OTC's tech club. I've been programming for a while prior to pursuing a degree at OTC, mainly just for fun. I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Lua, and C#. A few of my hobbies include programming, drawing pixel art, collecting Pok√©mon cards, 3D printing, procrastinating, and playing video games.
